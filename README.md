# 🧮 Java Data Structures Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed for my **Applications of Data Structures** course at Bowie State University. Each project demonstrates key computer science concepts including array manipulation, recursion, object-oriented programming, linked lists, and stacks.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 🔹 [Remove Element](./remove-element/RemoveElement.java)
This Java program removes a specified element from an array by creating a new array without that element, demonstrating index searching and element shifting.

### 🔹 [Recursion Stars](./recursion/RecursionStars.java)
This Java program prints stars using recursion to demonstrate basic recursive methods.

### 🔹 [Inventory Management with Classes](./classes/InventoryManagement.java)
This Java program uses a class to manage inventory data, allowing the user to enter item details and calculate the total cost through encapsulated class methods.

### 🔹 [Linked List Splitter](./linked-list/LinkedListSplit.java)
This Java program creates a custom linked list and splits it into two separate lists at a specified node, demonstrating insertion and node traversal operations.

### 🔹 [Stack Comparison](./stacks/StackComparison.java)
This Java program implements two stacks using linked lists, fills them with random integers, and compares the top values of each stack to track how often one exceeds the other.
